# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Having a daily planner helps one stay organized, set achievable goals, and meet deadlines.

Work Day Scheduler is a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The user can enter their notes and have the notes stored to view or update them later.

The app runs in the browser and was built using jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js.
